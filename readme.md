# FAQ
### Does this mod use AI?
No, it is using a very simple filter to try and only record sentences. Turning on noise suppression is recommended.
### Can I play this mod in singleplayer?
Yes, but the mod was made with multiplayer in mind.
### Does this mod store my voice?
Yes. Voice clips are stored in memory while in game, and when you leave it stores them on the Server Host's drive. If you'd prefer your voice to be deleted once you leave the server, turn on "Privacy Mode" on the mod's client settings.
### Why am I not seeing any Entities?
This mod is not trying to be in your face all the time. The spawn rates are configurable if you'd like to tweak your gameplay.

## Final statements

- A little insight on why this mod exists: We were tired of the horror mods we were playing and wanted to make a mod for ourselves to see how hard it is and voice chat seemed like the perfect idea to stand out from the others.
